# Transfer Learning with CNNs for Tool Wear Monitoring

Analysis of Transfer Learning to pre-trained Deep learning model architectures for classification applications.

This project explores the use of transfer learning to predict the tool wear from acquired sensor signal data :

NASA Mill Data was sourced, this data was obtained through CNC Milling experiments where sensor signal data including spindle motor current, acoustic emission and direct current signals were extracted.

The following conditions of experiments were carried out alternating the rpm and the depth of cut :

Transfer Learning was trialed with pretrained VGG16 model and the simpler LeNet-5 and VGG16 for tool wear classification and regression. The goal was to examine the impact of improved prediction performance with Transfer learning ,this was examined through prediction times, Root Mean Squared Error ,
