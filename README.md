# Transfer Learning with CNNs for Tool Wear Monitoring

Analysis of Transfer Learning to pre-trained Deep learning model architectures for classification applications.

This project explores the use of transfer learning to predict the tool wear from acquired sensor signal data. NASA mill data  signal data is acquired and processed in order to input into a Convolutional neural network :

Developed and Implemented predictive deep learning models to optimise the prediction accuracy of the tool wear of a component in Python using TensorFlow and Keras machine learning framework. 

Using NASA Mill Data obtained from CNC Milling experiments
